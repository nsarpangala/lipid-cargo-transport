Each column name carries information of the number of motors in the cargo (N), whether rotation was considered, and diffusion constant

Name has the following structure
AS(N)(diffusion constant)H(rotation)_v3(number of bound motors)

diffusion constant = R (rigid), D4 (Lipid with D = 1 \mu m^2/s)
rotation = R (with rotation), NR (without rotation)


Examples:
AS16RHNR_v31, has N=16, It is a rigid cargo (R), rotation was not considered (NR) and the number of bound motor is 1.
AS16D4HR_v33 , N=16, lipid cargo with with D = 1 \mu m^2/s, rotation was considered, number of bound motors was n=3
